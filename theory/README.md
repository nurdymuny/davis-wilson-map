# The Davis Framework: Unified Theory of Millennium Problems

## The Master Insight

Every Millennium Prize problem is asking the same question in a different domain:

> **"What is the geometric cost of distinguishability?"**

| Problem | Domain | The Question |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Yang-Mills Mass Gap** | Quantum Field Theory | Cost of distinguishing vacuum from excited states |
| **P vs NP** | Computational Complexity | Cost of distinguishing solutions from non-solutions |
| **Navier-Stokes** | Fluid Dynamics | Cost of distinguishing smooth flow from singular flow |
| **Riemann Hypothesis** | Number Theory | Cost of distinguishing zeros from non-zeros |
| **Hodge Conjecture** | Algebraic Geometry | Cost of distinguishing algebraic from transcendental |
| **BSD Conjecture** | Arithmetic Geometry | Cost of distinguishing finite from infinite rank |

## The Davis Law

All six problems instantiate a single master equation:

$$C = \frac{\tau}{K}$$

Where:
- **C** = Capacity (what the system can distinguish)
- **τ** = Tolerance (how much error is allowed)  
- **K** = Curvature (geometric cost of information)

When curvature vanishes (K → 0), capacity diverges (C → ∞)—this is the phase transition that each problem asks about.

## Papers in This Folder

| File | Problem | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `Davis_Hodge_Conjecture.pdf` | Hodge Conjecture | Conditional theorem (assumes Davis Framework axioms) |
| `Davis_BSD_Conjecture.pdf` | BSD Conjecture | Conditional theorem (assumes Davis Framework axioms) |

## Important Note on Status

These papers present **conditional theorems**, not unconditional proofs. They show:

1. **Translation**: Each Millennium Problem can be reformulated in Davis Framework language
2. **Equivalence**: Under the Davis axioms, the problem reduces to a phase transition
3. **Unification**: All six problems share the same geometric structure

The conditional nature is explicitly stated in each paper with hypothesis blocks (DW1–DW4 for BSD, DF1–DF4 for Hodge).

## The Foundational Program

These results depend on:

- **The Geometry of Sameness** — Foundational paper establishing the Davis Framework
- **Yang-Mills Mass Gap Solution** — First application (15σ experimental validation)
- **Davis-Wilson Map** — The key construction: Γ(A) = (Φ(A), r(A))
