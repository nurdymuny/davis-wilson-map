# Millennium Problems Validation Plan
## Davis Framework: c² = a² + b² + Δ

**Created:** December 11, 2025  
**Status:** VALIDATION IN PROGRESS

---

## Overview

Each domain faces a core attack vector. Our response: empirical validation against known results before claiming anything novel.

---

## 1. P vs NP

### Attack Vector
> "Geometric roughness isn't a complexity class. You're doing numerics, not proofs. This doesn't address the actual oracle separation problem."

### Validation Tests

| ID | Test | Expected Outcome | Status |
|----|------|------------------|--------|
| PNP-001 | Run framework on known P problems (sorting, shortest path) | Low Δ, smooth manifold | ⬜ |
| PNP-002 | Run framework on NP-complete problems (SAT, TSP, graph coloring) | High Δ, rough manifold | ⬜ |
| PNP-003 | Test Δ scaling with input size n | P: Δ ~ polylog(n), NP-complete: Δ ~ exp(n) | ⬜ |
| PNP-004 | Predict phase transition in random 3-SAT | Transition at clause/variable ratio ≈ 4.267 | ⬜ |
| PNP-005 | Test NP ∩ co-NP problems (factoring, parity games) | Intermediate Δ? | ⬜ |
| PNP-006 | Compare against known complexity hierarchies | Δ ordering matches P ⊂ NP ⊂ PSPACE | ⬜ |

### Data Sources
- SATLIB benchmark instances
- TSPLIB for traveling salesman
- Random k-SAT generators with known thresholds

## 2. Navier-Stokes

### Attack Vector
> "The Millennium Problem is about regularity—whether solutions blow up. Helicity is conserved in ideal fluids. You're not addressing singularity formation."

### Validation Tests

| ID | Test | Expected Outcome | Status |
|----|------|------------------|--------|
| NS-001 | Simulate Kida vortex evolution | Δ diverges before potential singularity | ⬜ |
| NS-002 | Test Euler equation blow-up candidates | Δ → ∞ signals loss of regularity | ⬜ |
| NS-003 | Recover Kolmogorov 5/3 scaling in turbulence | E(k) ~ k^(-5/3) in inertial range | ✅ PASS (0.1% err) |
| NS-004 | Match DNS turbulence simulations | Helicity barrier predicts dissipation rate | ⬜ |
| NS-005 | Distinguish 2D vs 3D behavior | 2D: bounded Δ (no blow-up), 3D: unbounded possible | ⬜ |
| NS-006 | Test Taylor-Green vortex decay | Match known enstrophy evolution | ⬜ |

### Data Sources
- Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database (JHTDB)
- Published DNS results (Kaneda et al., 2003)
- Taylor-Green benchmark parameters

## 3. Poincaré Conjecture (CONTROL CASE ✓)

### Attack Vector
> "Showing the same answer isn't the same as proving isomorphism. You could be approximating, not replicating."

### Validation Tests

| ID | Test | Expected Outcome | Status |
|----|------|------------------|--------|
| PC-001 | Formal equivalence: Δ evolution ↔ Ricci flow | Structural correspondence, not just numerical | ✅ PASS (r=0.959) |
| PC-002 | Handle surgery conditions (neck pinch) | Framework detects when to "cut" | ✅ PASS (detected) |
| PC-003 | Test extinction behavior | Manifold shrinks to point correctly | ⬜ |

| PC-006 | Document variable mapping | Explicit: our vars → Ricci flow vars | ⬜ |

### Completed Work
- Validated S³ convergence behavior
- Tested topological charge conservation

## 4. Hodge Conjecture

### Attack Vector
> "This is algebraic geometry. Your differential geometric framework doesn't speak this language. 'Translator cost' isn't a term of art."

### Validation Tests

| ID | Test | Expected Outcome | Status |
|----|------|------------------|--------|
| HC-001 | Test known Hodge classes on abelian varieties | Framework identifies algebraic cycles | ⬜ |

### Collaboration Needed
- Algebraic geometry expert for formal translation
- Access to computed Hodge structures database

## 5. Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD)

### Attack Vector
> "L-functions and ranks are number theory. Your geometric manifold has no business here."

### Validation Tests

| ID | Test | Expected Outcome | Status |
|----|------|------------------|--------|
| BSD-001 | Phase transition: L(E,1)=0 ↔ Δ=0 ↔ rank>0 | 100% phase classification | ✅ PASS (100%) |

## 6. Riemann Hypothesis [REDACTED TRACK]

### Attack Vector
> "The zeros are on the critical line or they're not. Numerical verification isn't proof. We've checked trillions of zeros."

4. ⬜ P vs NP (PNP-004 first - 3-SAT phase transition)

**Phase 3: Number Theory Bridge**
5. ⬜ BSD (BSD-001 first - database comparison)
6. ⬜ Riemann (RH-003 first - GUE statistics)

**Phase 4: Algebraic Geometry**
7. ⬜ Hodge (HC-006 first - CP^n baseline)

## Success Criteria

For each domain:
- [ ] Reproduce known results with framework
- [ ] Quantify prediction accuracy
- [ ] Document any discrepancies
- [ ] Identify novel predictions (if any)
- [ ] Peer review readiness

---

## Notes

- Each test should be independently reproducible
- Code and data for each test in `/validation/{domain}/`
- Results documented in `/results/{domain}/`
- Failures are valuable—they constrain the framework
